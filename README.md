# code-refactor

I changed all the tags for this code, to make sure it's more accessible for visually impaired user.
I Changed all the "div" tags to the appropriate tags and sematic html formay.
I also cleaned up the code to be more efficient with less coding.
 
 In the CSS file I did the samething as the html file, and I made it more efficient 
 by deleteing code that was not needed. And I use the approprite tags and matched it to the html file
